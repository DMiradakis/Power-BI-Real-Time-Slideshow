# SlideShowPowerBI

This is a extension for Google Chrome to display with slideshow the reports from Power BI.
<p>I made this app to view reports on TV

## Install Extension
1. Go to "Extensions" in Google Chrome
2. Check "Developer mode"
3. In "Load unpacked extension" load the this repository. 
#### The folder to be loaded should be with the files inside, if when you load you have this error "Could not load the manifest" it's because you're carrying the wrong folder.

## Working

When you are in the Power BI report, click the icon button and the slide show should be start.
